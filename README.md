## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global renewable energy production based on the dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/renewable-energy). The data has been cleaned and transformed into an interactive Tableau dashboard, providing valuable insights into renewable energy trends.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to deliver an in-depth and interactive exploration of renewable energy data, offering valuable insights into worldwide renewable energy production, country-specific patterns, and the pivotal role of hydroelectric energy. 

## Dashboard Visualizations

The interactive dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. **Global Renewable Energy Production**: An overview of global renewable energy production.
2. **Renewable Energy Production by Countries**: Detailed insights into renewable energy production using filter for countries and years.
3. **% of Total Renewable Energy Production by Countries**: A percentage breakdown of renewable energy sources using filter for countries and years.
4. **Top 10 Countries Producing Electricity from Hydro in 2021**: Ranking of countries by hydroelectric energy production in 2021.
5. **Top 10 Countries Producing Electricity from Solar in 2021**: Ranking of countries by solar energy production in 2021.
6. **Top 10 Countries Producing Electricity from Wind in 2021**: Ranking of countries by wind energy production in 2021.
7. **Top 10 Countries Producing Electricity from Other Sources in 2021**: Ranking of countries by renewable energy production from sources other than hydro, solar, and wind in 2021.
8. **Renewables (% Primary Energy Equivalent) by Countries**: Visualization of the percentage of renewables in the primary energy mix for various countries using filter for years.
9. **Renewables (% Primary Energy Equivalent) between 1965 - 2021**: Analysis of renewable energy trends between 1965 and 2021 using filter for countries.
10. **Biofuels Production by Countries**: A comprehensive view of biofuels production by different countries.
11. **Geothermal Capacity of Countries**: A comparison of geothermal energy capacity among countries.

## Key Insights

Here are some key insights from the renewable energy data:

- In 2021, China emerged as the leading producer of renewable energy from wind, solar, and other sources, including biofuels.

- Japan excelled in producing electricity from hydro sources in 2021, ranking as the top hydroelectric energy producer.

- Hydroelectric energy dominated the global renewable energy landscape, accounting for a significant portion of the total energy produced in 2021 with 4,230 TWh.

- Norway led the way in renewable energy adoption, with renewables constituting an impressive 71% of its primary energy equivalent in 2021.
